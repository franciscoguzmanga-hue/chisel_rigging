Project: "Chisel" – A Rigging Productivity Tool (Maya) The concept behind this tool is to act as a "chisel" for precision work. While an "autorig" is the hammer that does the heavy lifting, manual rigging is often slowed down by repetitive tasks that require multiple clicks. This tool provides a "scalpel-like" precision to modify or improve rigs, whether they were built in-house or received from external studios.

The key capabilities include:

Creation & Hierarchy: Simplify the creation of basic elements (Locators, Joints, Groups) at selection points and build hierarchies based on selection order.

Deformation & Skinning: Extract skinned joints from meshes and copy skinning from one object to multiple selections (transform or component).

Control Rigging: Advanced control creation and manipulation (offsets, constraints, direct connections, and shape/color customization).

Automated Setups: Local rig creation, automatic blendshape target assignment, and simple module creation (FK, Ribbon).

Attribute Management: Create proxy attributes and modify default values.

The "Surgery" Module: * Nodes: Manage and rename constraints, skinClusters, and blendshape nodes.

Cleanup: Unlock nodes, remove unused/unknown nodes, and toggle axis or joint visibility.

Advanced Filtering: Filter selections by type (Joint, Locator, Mesh, Nurbs) or by hierarchy (leaf nodes vs. non-leaf nodes).
